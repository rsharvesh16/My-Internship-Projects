Project Title : Phishing URL Detection \\
Editors Used : VS Code, Jupyter NB, Pycharm
Over the past few weeks, I have been working diligently on developing a robust system to identify phishing attempts in real-time. I found the project quite interesting, and during the internship, I was tasked with developing a Machine Learning Model to detect URLs containing any threats or malware. I utilized the Random Forest algorithm, which yielded an impressive accuracy of around 96%, and deployed it as a web application using Streamlit.
This project taught me a lot on Machine Learning and about Random Forest Classifier. I would like to thank VIEH for providing this internship opportunity and making such a great project.
